# <Week 1 Challenge>

## Description

This particular website had a few issues with the code and a few other bugs. My job is to refactor the existing code to fix the  bugs and improve the website itself through reorganizing the code and making it more accessible for users. I went through the HTML and CSS files to add and modify the code to make it more semantic and clean. In doing so, I fixed the navigational links and improved upon the accessibility of the website. This makes it easier for users with disabilities to access and use the website.
